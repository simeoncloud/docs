# The Simeon Baseline: A comprehensive set of best practice Microsoft 365 configurations.

Welcome to the Simeon Baseline. Simeon Cloud has expertly configured these settings to optimize your Microsoft 365 environments in accordance with industry best practices. This list represents the most important, relevant and security-focused configurations across Azure AD, Office 365, and Intune. These configurations can be deployed to a tenant to provide a fully functional environment out of the box, capable of enrolling devices using Autopilot, managing devices using Intune and providing secure access to Office 365 for users.

## Summary of security-focused configurations

### Data loss prevention (DLP)
- Users can only access corporate data from:
  - Compliant corporate devices managed by Intune
  - In-office locations
  - Approved applications on personal mobile devices
- Corporate data on personal mobile devices are restricted from leaving approved client applications, preventing data loss
- Integration with third-party services, such as LinkedIn, Dropbox, Google Drive, personal Microsoft accounts, etc., is disabled

### Security auditing
- Microsoft 365 is configured to audit and optionally alert on all login and device management operations

### Authentication
- Multifactor authentication is required whenever authenticating from a personal device or as an administrator
- Corporate devices have a randomized local administrator password

### Endpoint security
- Corporate devices block the use of simple passwords
- Corporate devices are blocked from communicating using insecure protocols
- Corporate devices are encrypted
- Corporate devices use a fixed list of trusted internet sites
- Corporate devices are continuously monitored for security compliance, including encryption status, antivirus protection, and malware protection; non-compliant devices are restricted from accessing corporate data

### Data retention
- All corporate data in O365 is retained for one year, including emails, chat, and files

### User privileges
- End users are restricted from connecting their personal Windows computers to O365

### Sign-In Risk Policy

|Name |Sign-In Risk Policy|
| :-- | :-- |
| What does this do? | Analyzes user sign-ins and calculates a risk score based on the probability that the sign-in was not performed by the user. If a risky sign-in is detected, the user will be prompted for MFA. |
| Why should you use this? | This protects your tenants from nefarious sign-in attempts. |
| What is the end-user impact? | When a sign-in attempt is flagged as risky, the user will be required to complete MFA. If a user has not yet registered for MFA on their account, they would be blocked from accessing their account. You must configure the MFA registration policy for all users who are a part of the sign-in risk policy to ensure that they are not locked out of their accounts. |

|Name |Baseline - OS - Set-TimeZone|
| :-- | :-- |

### Baseline - Security - Add-AuthenticatedUsersToRemoteDesktopUsers

|Name |Baseline - Security - Add-AuthenticatedUsersToRemoteDesktopUsers|
| :-- | :-- |

### Baseline - Security - Disable-RdpNetworkLevelAuthentication

|Name |Baseline - Security - Disable-RdpNetworkLevelAuthentication|
| :-- | :-- |
| What does this do? | Disables Network Level Authentication as a requirement for Remote Desktop. This is required to support clients that do not support Network Level Authentication. |
| Why should you use this? | To allow connections via Remote Desktop from non-Azure AD joined devices. |
| What is the end-user impact? | Users may connect remotely via Remote Desktop. |
| Learn more | It is not currently possible to use Network Level Authentication when using Remote Desktop to connect from a non-Azure AD joined device to an Azure AD joined device. Removing the requirement for Network Level Authentication will not prevent clients from trying to negotiate Network Level Authentication if they support it. That means that Windows clients that are not joined to the same Azure AD as the host must explicitly add "enablecredsspsupport:i:0" in the .rdp file when connecting to prevent attempts to pre-authenticate. |

## Intune > Devices > Windows Autopilot deployment profiles
*MSGraph/DeviceManagement/WindowsAutopilotDeploymentProfiles*

###### hidden-header

### Baseline - Self Deploying Profile

|Name |Baseline - Self Deploying Profile|
| :-- | :-- |
| What does this do? | Creates an Intune Autopilot profile for enrolling machines using the self-deploying method, which enables a device to be enrolled into your environment with little to no user interaction. Self-deployment mode comes with restrictions including that the device must have TPM 2.0, and it is not supported on virtual machines even if they have a virtual TPM. Devices in the Azure AD group "Baseline - Autopilot Devices - Self Deploying" will be assigned this profile. |
| Why should you use this? | This is most useful for devices that will be shared or used as a kiosk. If a device is going to be used by a single user it is best to use the user-driven method. |
| What is the end-user impact? | User devices assigned to this profile can be configured using the self-deployment method. |

###### hidden-header

### Baseline - User Driven Profile

|Name |Baseline - User Driven Profile|
| :-- | :-- |
| What does this do? | Creates an Intune Autopilot profile for enrolling machines using the user-driven method. Devices in the Azure AD group "Autopilot Devices - User Driven" will be assigned this profile. |
| Why should you use this? | When a device is going to be used by a single user, this approach is ideal because the device shows as assigned in all relevant Intune pages and reports. It is also the most stable and consistent Autopilot mode. |
| What is the end-user impact? | Devices with this profile can be enrolled by users themselves. The device will be registered to the user and the user will be able to use the company portal application. |

| Why should you use this? | You can set up alerts for when a managed device is marked non-compliant or when a new device is enrolled into the environment. This improves security by providing you with the data needed to monitor Intune events within your tenant. |
