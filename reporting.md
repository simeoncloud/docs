# Simeon Cloud Power BI Reporting

Report on your Simeon Sync data from a single location. Use one of our built-in reports or create your own from the raw data.

## Tenant updates
When installing Simeon Cloud Power BI Reporting, the installer will make the following changes to the tenant selected to host the Power BI report:
- Creates the Simeon Cloud **Power BI Workspace**
- Creates the **Azure Resource Group** named simeoncloudreporting
- Creates a **Log Analytics workspace** named SimeonCloud
    - Defaults to the Analytic logs Pay-As-You-Go tier, see [here for pricing information](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/monitor/)
- Creates a **Log Analytics data collection endpoint**
- Creates a **Log Analytics data collection rule**
- Creates a **Service Principal** named Simeon Cloud Reporting with the role **Monitoring Metrics Publisher** on the SimeonCloud Log Analytics workspace and **admin accesss** to the Power BI Workspace
- **Generates a client secret** for Simeon Cloud Power BI Reporting and saves it as a secure variable in an Azure DevOps Variable Group shared only with your tenant pipelines
- Updates the Power BI tenant setting to **allow Service Principals access to the Power BI APIs**
- Updates the Power BI setting to provide the **logged in user access to create Power BI workspaces**
    - Power BI defaults restrict workspace creation to accounts with rights to create M365 Groups. If your tenant has this setting and the account running the installer is not allowed to create M365 Groups, the account will be added to the group of users allowed to create M365 groups

## Installation
The first step to install Simeon Power BI Reporting is to determine which tenant will host the report. If you're an MSP, we recommend installing into your MSP's own tenant. If you're an enterprise, we recommend installing into your production tenant. The tenant must have an Azure Subscription.

- Have a **Power BI Pro license**
- Have **logged in to [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com)** at least once
- Have either **Owner** role on the **Azure Subscription** or **all the following roles on the Azure Subscription**:
    - Contributor
    - User Access Administrator
- Have either the **Global Administrator role** or **all the following Azure AD roles**:
    - Application Administrator
    - Groups Administrator
    - Fabric Administrator

## Backfill Sync Integrations
The backfill job uploads historical data to Power BI and keeps the reports up to date.

## Baseline Compliance Report
<br />
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simeoncloud/docs/master/assets/images/power_bi.png" width: 700; height: auto;/>

*This screenshot shows the Baseline Compliance Report for a demo environment.*

The Baseline Compliance Report displays how each of your tenants compare to their baseline. You can see the comparison **by tenant**, **type of configuration**, and **configuration**. You can also drill down to see how properties in a **specific configuration** compare to the baseline.

The data in the Baseline Compliance Report uses Power BI [import connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-directquery-about#import-connections) and is refreshed every 3 hours, which is the max number of automated refreshes allowed in Power BI Pro. You can refresh the report manually when viewing in Power BI. To do so:
- Go to [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com) > **Workspaces** > **Simeon Cloud**
- Hover your mouse over the **Baseline Compliance Report** dataset > Click on the **refresh** icon

## Building custom reports and alerts
Simeon Cloud's integration of Power BI Reporting with Log Analytics provides significant opportunities to monitor tenants using custom reports and targeted alerts. The following resources are designed to help Simeon users interested in developing custom reports and alerts get started.

### Custom Log Analytics queries
Log Analytics allows you to develop specific queries using the data in your Log Analytics workspace. With Simeon Cloud, you can use the [Simeon Sync dataset](https://simeoncloud.github.io/docs/#/reporting?id=simeon-sync-power-bi-dataset) to tailor queries around nearly all aspects of your tenant configurations. To understand how Log Analytics works and how to start building custom queries, see [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial).

#### Sample Log Analytics queries
The following custom queries were developed using the [Simeon Sync dataset](https://simeoncloud.github.io/docs/#/reporting?id=simeon-sync-power-bi-dataset) and highlight what is possible with Log Analytics integration within Simeon Cloud. Users are encouraged to develop custom queries to target specific resources and conditions of interest.
* Different configurations can be specified using Microsoftâ€™s API's schema with colons between the path. In Simeon, this can be found in the parenthesis of the Sync Summary report: Azure AD > Security > Conditional Access > Policies (MSGraph:ConditionalAccess:Policies).

*A configuration type is added/removed/changed in the portal and exported by Simeon Sync*
```
SyncLogs_CL
| where Change_Type in ('Added', 'Removed', 'Changed') and Configuration_Type in ('MSGraph:ConditionalAccess:Policies')
```
*A specific tenant has an export/deploy/preview change. Update tenant_name_here to the correct tenant name.*
```
SyncLogs_CL
| where Change_Type in ('Added', 'Removed', 'Changed') and Tenant == 'tenant_name_here'
```
*A Conditional Access policy is changed from enabled to disabled or reporting only, or the policy is deleted*
```
SyncLogs_CL
| where Change_Type in ('Added', 'Removed', 'Changed') and Configuration_Type in ('MSGraph:ConditionalAccess:Policies') and Property_Name == 'state' and Old_Property_Value == 'enabled'
```

### Building custom alerts
Log Analytics allows you to turn queries into custom alerting rules. These alerts can be powerful ways to monitor for changes in your tenants and receive notifications or automate certain actions. To create custom alerts, follow the steps in [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-create-new-alert-rule?tabs=metric#create-or-edit-an-alert-rule-in-the-azure-portal).

### Build custom Power BI reports
Simeon includes a **Baseline Compliance Report** and **Summary of Detected Changes report** by default. Users are encouraged to create their own custom reports with the data in the Simeon Sync Power BI dataset. In addition, users can create Power BI reports directly from Log Analytics. To create custom Power BI reports, [follow these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/create-dataset-log-analytics#create-a-dataset-from-log-analytics).

### Simeon Sync Power BI dataset
You may use this dataset to develop custom queries for Log Analytics alerts and Power BI reports. Each row in the data source represents a single property of a configuration.

The fields available in the dataset are as follows:
- Organization: The DevOps organization the tenant is in
- Tenant: The name of the tenant running the sync
- Action: The Sync stage, e.g., **export**, **preview**, **deploy**
- Sync_Run_Name: Specified by the user at Sync time, otherwise the automated name of the run given by Azure DevOps
- Sync_Comment: Additional comments entered when running from the Sync page
- Sync_Date_Time: The date and time of the Sync in UTC time zone
- Configuration: The name of the configuration
- Configuration_Full_Name: The full name of the configuration, including the path where the configuration can be found
- Configuration_Description: If the configuration is from the Simeon Baseline this provides a full description about the config
- Configuration_Type: The configuration type used by Simeon to distinguish where a config should be deployed to. Follows Microsoft's API's with colons between the path, i.e. MSGraph:Groups
- Configuration_Type_Description: The translation of the Configuration Type
- Baseline_Name: The name of the baseline the tenant is using. If the tenant does not have a baseline, the value is **[No Baseline]**
- Baseline_Property_Value: The baseline value of the property (if applicable) at the time of the Sync
- Configuration_Reconciliation_Type: The section that the configuration falls into on the Reconcile Screen - **only in tenant**, **available from baseline**, **conflicting with baseline**, **matching baseline**
- Property_Reconciliation_Type: Similar to the Configuration Reconcile Type, but at the property level
- Property_Name: The name of the property being reported on
- Property_Value: The value of the property at the time of the sync
- Old_Property_Value: Captures the previous value of the property before the Sync changes are applied
- Change_Type: The action the Sync performed - **Removed**, **Added**, **Changed**, **Unchanged**, **Skipped**
- Error_Message: If the configuration fails for any reason, the full error message is captured in this column

## Uninstall Power BI Reporting

### Uninstall Azure SQL
Prior to August 2023, Power BI read from Azure SQL. It is now recommended to remove Azure SQL in favor of Log Analytics for Simeon Cloud Power BI reports. To do so:
- Delete the resource group named **SimeonCloudReporting** from [portal.microsoft.com](https://portal.microsoft.com/) > Resource groups
    - Note, if Log Analytics has already been installed, delete the following resources from the resource group:
        - simeoncloudreporting-tenantname SQL Server
        - SimeonCloud SQL database
- Delete the App registration named **Simeon Cloud Power BI Reporting** from [portal.microsoft.com](https://portal.microsoft.com/) > App registrations
- In [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com), remove the dataset and report named **Simeon Sync**
- Update the Library in Azure DevOps to remove all variables that start with **SQLAzure**. Go to [DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/) > Tenants > Pipelines > Library > Variable Groups > Sync > remove the following:
    - SQLAzureAppId
    - SQLAzureAppSecret
    - SQLAzureServerAdminPassword
    - SQLAzureServerAdminUserName
    - SQLAzureServerName
    - SQLAzureTenant
- You may now [reinstall Power BI Reporting](https://simeoncloud.github.io/docs/#/reporting?id=installation) to transition to the Log Analytics workspace

### Uninstall Log Analytics
Power BI Reporting installed after August 2023 reads from a Log Analytics workspace by default. To remove Power BI Reporting with Log Analytics, do the following:
- Delete the resource group named **simeoncloudreporting** from [portal.microsoft.com](https://portal.microsoft.com/) > Resource groups
- Delete the Service Principal named **Simeon Cloud Reporting** from [portal.microsoft.com](https://portal.microsoft.com/) > Enterprise applications
- Update the Library in Azure DevOps to remove all variables that start with **LogAnalytics** AND **SimeonSync**. Go to [DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/) > Tenants > Pipelines > Library > Variable Groups > Sync > remove the following:
    - LogAnalyticsResourceId
    - LogAnalyticsEndpointUrl
    - SimeonSyncIntegrationTenant
    - SimeonSyncIntegrationAppSecret
    - SimeonSyncIntegrationAppId

## Q & A
### Can I make changes to the reports deployed by Simeon?
Simeon continually enhances reports. Pushing these report updates to your tenant requires deleting the existing report and creating a new copy. So, any customizations you make to the report will be removed when the **Backfill Sync Integrations** is run. If you accidentally lose changes to your reports, please contact support@simeoncloud.com.

### Can I use the dataset to build my own reports?
Yes! If you build a report you think others might benefit from, let us know. We are happy to spread the word!

### I don't have a Power BI Pro license; can I still see the workspace?
Accessing a shared Power BI workspace requires at least a Power BI Pro license assigned to the user accessing the workspace. If you are unsure that you want to signup, Power BI offers several trial options. Also, a Power BI Pro license is included in the **Office E5 license**.
